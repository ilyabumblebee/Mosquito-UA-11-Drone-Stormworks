With its compact design and advanced sensors, the Mosquito drone is capable of operating in challenging environments, including high winds, rain, and low light conditions.
Equipped with a high-resolution camera and advanced mapping software, the Mosquito drone is capable of capturing detailed aerial imagery and generating 3D maps of the surrounding area(trying to implement). This makes it an invaluable tool for search and rescue operations, allowing emergency responders to quickly identify potential hazards and locate missing persons.
In addition to its advanced imaging capabilities, the Mosquito drone is also equipped with a range of sensors, including infrared sensors, which allow it to detect hazards or lost people at low-light conditions from a safe distance. This makes it an ideal tool for surveillance and reconnaissance missions, allowing operators to gather valuable intelligence without putting themselves at risk.
Overall, the UA-11 "Mosquito" Drone is a highly capable and versatile platform, capable of performing a wide range of tasks in challenging environments. Whether you're a first responder, a photographer, or a researcher, this advanced drone is sure to be a valuable addition to your toolkit.

TECHNICAL DATA

Mosquito has a flying range of approximately 100 kilometers (Aux tanks can extend it up to 300km). However, this range can vary depending on various factors such as the weather conditions, the load of the drone, flying mode, and the altitude at which it is flying. Also now it is limited to about 20-30km due to game RX transmitters. The drone is equipped with an advanced navigation system that allows it to navigate through difficult terrains and obstacles with ease. It also has an auto-return AP feature that enables it to return to the base in case of a loss of communication or manually if required. Additionally, the drone AP settings can be remotely adjusted from the command center, which allows the operator to edit its flight path and monitor its progress in real-time. The drone is  fast and maneuverable with a maximum speed of approximately 50 knots (57 mph or 92 km/h). This impressive speed allows the drone to quickly cover a large area during its missions, making it a valuable tool in a big variety of fields. Thanks to its lightweight and efficient design, the aircraft can achieve this speed while also maintaining excellent stability in flight. Its high-performance engines and advanced flight control systems allow it to navigate through challenging conditions and fly at high altitudes with ease. The bird is equipped with an Eco Mode that allows the engine to operate at a lower RPS (Rotations Per Second) to conserve fuel and extend the drone's range. When operating in Eco Mode, the drone's lifting capacity is reduced, which means it cannot carry as much weight as it would in normal mode. If the throttle is increased too much, the Eco Mode will automatically disable to provide more power to the rotors and increase a stability of device. This is to ensure the safety of the drone and prevent it from crashing. However, if the drone is operated without any payload, Eco Mode can be utilized to significantly increase the drone's range, making it an efficient option for long-distance operations. The status of Eco Mode and the amount of fuel being used can be monitored through the data screen in the drone's control station. This information is important to ensure that the drone operates within safe limits and that the pilot is aware of its fuel consumption. Overall, Eco Mode is a useful feature that provides a balance between efficiency and lifting capacity. Also heli is equipped with a Data Screen that provides a wealth of information about its various systems. This screen is located in the control station and displays real-time data such as light status, engine data, fuel usage, payload information, and much more. The Data Screen is particularly useful because it provides detailed information about the status of all systems on the drone. This includes systems that are toggled on and off with push buttons, which are indicated on the screen with their status. For example, if the camera mast is raised, the status indicator for the camera mast will display "On" on the Data Screen. Additionally, the Data Screen provides information on the drone's throttle level and the status of its eco mode. When the drone is in eco mode, its status and fuel usage can be seen on the Data Screen.

PAYLOAD MODULES

The UA-11 drone is equipped with two KB-01 Laser Guided Missiles that can be used for targeting purposes. The missiles are set to target the same laser frequency that the drone is using. The laser frequency can be viewed on the payload screen, and the frequency can be changed by pressing the "set frequency" button. Once armed, the missiles detect targets and display a circle in the targeting FOV box. The closer the target is to the center of the FOV, the more likely the missile is to track it. The missile has a range of up to 2000m and uses the vehicle's gyroscopic and GPS data for targeting. It is important to note that weapons must be armed before firing. The drone also has the option to attach external fuel tanks to increase its runtime during missions. The fuel use data will be displayed on the payload screen. The payload system on the drone uses a standardized set of composite signals, allowing for endless payload options. This means that you can make your own modules and attach them!

SHORT SYSTEM OPERATION GUIDE

Command Center
Door Lock - Indicators to the left of the door indicate the locked status. The lock can be switched on via a switch on the panel inside the command center to the right of the door. If the lock is enabled, the door will only be unlocked if the numbers on the inside and outside keypad are the same.

Camera Mast - The camera mast can be raised from the panel inside and to the right of the door. When raised, visible and IR strobe lights can be toggled from the same panel, and the screen to the right of the control station seat can display the camera view and control orientation.

Antenna - The antenna must be raised to enable communication with the drone. If stowed while the drone is active, the drone will enter an auto return mode to whatever coordinates were specified. The antenna can be actuated from the panel inside the door and to the right.

Control Station - The control station has multiple screens when connected to the drone, and can be used to change many settings on the drone. The displays can be set to whatever screen desired by pressing the buttons to the left or right of each screen. An indicator will light up to indicate the screen being displayed. To return to the default HUD, press the button for whichever screen is active to deselect it.

There are 7 different screens to choose from:
1.	HUD/Forward Camera (default)
2.	Laser Designator/Camera
3.	Downward Facing Camera (Landing/Winch Cam)
4.	Map/Radar/Waypoint Screen
5.	Vehicle Data
6.	Left Hardpoint Data (if payload is connected)
7.	Right Hardpoint Data (if payload is connected)

Below the screens you will find the main control panel:
https://imgur.com/qrjv3Qf
1.	Start engines
2.	Stop engines (must hold 2 seconds)
3.	Toggle Eco mode (will autodisable if load is too heavy, status can be checked in vehicle data screen)
4.	Switch Cameras to IR Mode
5.	Activate Landing Lights (forward and downward spotlights)
6.	Toggle Navigation Lights (Red/Green/White, status displayed in vehicle data screen)
7.	Toggle Anti Collision Lights (red strobes, status displayed in vehicle data screen)

9.	Jettison Right Hardpoint (must arm right side first)
10.	Winch Up (if load is connected)
11.	Winch Down (if load is connected)
12.	Enable Alt Hold (will set alt hold to the desired altitude, ground level, or 0 m whichever is higher)
13.	Enable Autopilot (points must be set in the Map Screen)
14.	AutoReturn (will fly drone to predesignated location and attempt to land, also activates with loss of signal to drone)
15.	Set autoreturn coordinates (will upload coordinates currently in keyboard to autoland system)
16.	Sends targeting altitude to drone (this gets passed to the drone hardpoints for payloads to use as targeting data if desired)
17.	Sends targeting coordinates to drone (also used to set autoreturn coordinates, does not effect autopilot coordinates)
18.	Altitude hold setting
19.	Laser Frequency setting (determines what frequency the targeting laser is set too)

FUTURE PLANS

Implement LIDAR functionality

Add Better Antennas to the game (almost ready)

Fix minor bugs and not working stuff

Add low fuel force RTH with adjustable amount

Add more coloring to drone and station

Updating RADAR, NAV map and other outdated stuff

Control station optimization for 9x5 screens

Maybe something else what I forgot about

Also if you have any ideas, share them with me and report all bugs. Thanks!
